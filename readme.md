Project 501

Welcome to our Lodging Data Analysis Project!  
This README provides an overview of the project, how it was structured, and what I accomplished, including data handling, model design, and data visualization. This project was built with Python using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

Project Overview

In this project, I developed a system to analyze lodging data (e.g., hotels, cottages, beach houses) based on various attributes like date, name, category, type, rating, price, and average revenue. This project helped explore patterns in lodging types and categories, with visualizations to make insights more accessible.

Features

	1.	Class Design for Lodging:
	•	Created a base class Lodging to capture essential attributes of a lodging property.
	•	Designed subclass hierarchies (Travel and Vacation), with further specialization for HotelRoom, Cottage, and BeachHouse.
	2.	Data Loading and Conversion:
	•	Loaded a pickled dataset containing lodging objects from a .dat file.
	•	Converted the data into a structured pandas DataFrame.
	•	Ensured data type accuracy by converting columns like price and average_revenue to numeric types, handling any parsing issues by replacing non-numeric values with NaNs.
	3.	Data Export:
	•	Saved the structured data to a CSV file for easy access and further analysis.
	4.	Data Visualization:
	•	Created visual representations of the data, including:
	•	A bar chart displaying total average revenue by lodging category.
	•	A pie chart for proportions of lodging types.
	•	A scatter plot showing the relationship between price and average_revenue.

Project Structure

	•	Lodging Class: Contains core attributes for all lodging data, including date, name, category, type, rating, price, and average_revenue.
	•	Subclass Hierarchy: Specialized subclasses (Travel and Vacation) further divide into types (HotelRoom, Cottage, and BeachHouse) with inheritance for each lodging type.
	•	Data Handling and Visualization:
	•	Lodgingpkl638250102.dat: Dataset containing pickled objects representing lodging entries.
	•	lodging_data.csv: CSV file generated by the script.
	•	Visualizations: Created using matplotlib to display data trends and insights.

Dependencies

To run this project, install the following Python packages:

pip install pandas matplotlib

Code Walkthrough

	1.	Classes and Inheritance:
	•	The Lodging class is a base class with essential attributes for each lodging entry.
	•	Subclasses inherit and customize these attributes, with:
	•	Travel for travel accommodations (HotelRoom type).
	•	Vacation for vacation-specific lodgings like Cottage and BeachHouse.
	2.	Data Loading:
	•	Loaded objects from Lodgingpkl638250102.dat using pickle.load() and processed into a DataFrame.
	•	Converted non-numeric entries in price and average_revenue to NaN to avoid data type issues.
	3.	Data Export:
	•	Saved each lodging entry to lodging_data.csv using a structured format for easy readability and future use.
	4.	Data Visualization:
	•	Bar Chart: Shows total average revenue across categories (e.g., Travel, Vacation), allowing easy comparison.
	•	Pie Chart: Illustrates proportions of lodging types (Travel vs. Vacation).
	•	Scatter Plot: Highlights the relationship between price and average_revenue.

How to Run the Project

	1.	Ensure the dependencies (pandas, matplotlib, and pickle) are installed.
	2.	Run the script:

python lodging_analysis.py


	3.	The visualizations will display sequentially, showing various aspects of the lodging data.

Further enhancements and refinements to be made (the above code is not final.)

Latest Commit:



In the latest commit, we have made the following significant changes:

	1.	Data Handling Enhancements:
	•	Implemented missing value handling by filling numerical variables (price, average_revenue, rating) with their median values.
	•	Filled missing categorical variables (date, name, category, type) with their mode values.
	•	This ensures that our dataset is complete and reduces the potential bias that could be introduced by simply dropping missing values.
	2.	Updated Visualizations:
	•	Added Appropriate Labels and Titles: Each graph now includes clear titles indicating the figure number and visualization type, as well as descriptive axis labels.
	•	Figure Numbers: Introduced figure numbers in the titles (e.g., “Figure 1: Bar Chart - Total Average Revenue by Lodging Category”) for easy reference and clarity.
	•	Consistent Styling and Formatting: Applied consistent styling across all visualizations using seaborn for better aesthetics and readability.
	3.	Code Refinements:
	•	Optimized the code by utilizing pandas’ built-in functions for data handling and export (e.g., using df.to_csv() for saving the DataFrame).
	•	Ensured that the code is modular and organized, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
	4.	Updated README:
	•	Revised the README file to reflect the latest changes, including detailed explanations of data handling methods and visualization enhancements.
	•	Added this Latest Commit section to explicitly mention the recent updates made to the project.
